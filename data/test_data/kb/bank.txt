Bank.

A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit.
Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets.
Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries.
Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities.
In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords.

Banking in its modern sense evolved in the 14th century in the rich cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world.
In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties — notably, the Medicis, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the Berenbergs and the Rothschilds — have played a central role over many centuries.
The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank.

Banking began with the first prototype banks of merchants of the ancient world, which made grain loans to farmers and traders who carried goods between cities.
This began around 2000 BC in Assyria and Babylonia.
Later, in ancient Greece and during the Roman Empire, lenders based in temples made loans and added two important innovations: they accepted deposits and changed money.
Archaeology from this period in ancient China and India also shows evidence of money lending activity.

The origins of modern banking can be traced to medieval and early Renaissance Italy, to the rich cities in the north like Florence, Lucca, Siena, Venice and Genoa.
The Bardi and Peruzzi families dominated banking in 14th-century Florence, establishing branches in many other parts of Europe.
One of the most famous Italian banks was the Medici Bank, set up by Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici in 1397.
The earliest known state deposit bank, Banco di San Giorgio (Bank of St.George), was founded in 1407 at Genoa, Italy.
